# Colorul Waves

## Description

In this workshop, we will take a handful of wires and resistors and create cacophonous bleeps and bloops. We will work through three basic circuits, making simple square wave oscillators, elevate to 8-bit sounding tones, and graduate to a simple sequencer that you can use for live performances, public installations and any other sound-related projects. This hands-on workshop will provide tips and tricks for making your own instruments or interactive noise machines, with time to experiment and customize as you learn about electronics and sound. Prepare to get noisy and loud.

You donâ€™t need to have any electronics experience to participate! Materials and instructions will be included, and I guarantee that anyone will be able to walk out of this workshop with something pleasantly squealing and shrieking.
